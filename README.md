# Date-night-in
The objective of this project is to create a website that will allow customized date night for the users.

User story

So as someone who is trying to plan a date night in, I would like to be able to generate a meal and something to watch randomly so I donâ€™t have to actually plan anything myself.

As a user I want to be able to generate a date-night-in and save for future use in order to prepare (example - purchasing certain ingredients).

As a user I want to be able to generate a meal and filter recipes by allergies and dietary needs to cater to those who have dietary restrictions.

As a user I want to be able to filter by type of cuisine.

As a user I want to be able to generate movies by genre.

As a user I want to be able to generate movies by review ratings.

As a user I want to be able to filter my movies between paid steamed services VS free streaming services.

As a user I want to be able to filter my movies based off ratings (PG, PG-13, Rated-R)

AS A USER
WHEN I arrive at the landing page
THEN I want to be presented with a Nav Bar, A random date button, and my recent dates.
When I see the nav bar
THEN I want to be presented with a home button, a favorites tab, upcoming dates, and a filters tab
WHEN I go to the favorites page
THEN I want to see dates I have saved

THEN I a am taken to a new page with the movie (and info), the recipe (in detail) and an option to save it as my favorite
WHEN I am on any page
THEN I can still see my nav bar
WHEN I go to the filters tab
THEN I see options to filter my movies by genre and rating (pg-13 etc), and option to filter recipes by dietary restrictions, cuisine, etc.
WHEN I click the filter button on the nav bar
THEN I am presented with a either pop up, drop down, or new page for selecting my filters
(WHEN I see a new random date) 
(THEN I see buttons bellow the movie and the recipe to be able to generate a new random item for either)
WHEN I see a new random date I am happy with
THEN I can click a button to confirm that date, which saves it to my date list
WHEN I go to a date 
THEN I can click a button to delete it
WHEN I visit a date page
THEN the movie has a fixed position and follows me as a scroll down through the recipe
