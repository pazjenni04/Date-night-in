# Date-night-in
The objective of this project is to create a date night in where the webpage will generate a random movie and recipe to create a hassle-free date-night-in experience. 

When the user first arrives at on the homepage, they will be presented with the following window.

![The following image displays the viewport for the user when first directed onto the page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pazjenni04/Date-night-in/main/assets/images/home-page.PNG)

From here, the user will be instructed to click on the random button presented in the middle of the page.

Once the user clicks on the "Random button generator" then the webpage will populate a random movie and recipe and display it onto a modal window.  Here, the window will display the movie's movie poster, title, the cast members, the director, the movie plot, the year the movie was released, the movie rating, the genre of the movie, and the movie runtime.

Along with generating a random movie, the button will generate a random recipe as well in order to create a hassle-free date-night-in.  Displayed onto the modal, the recipe result will provide the user with the recipe image, the title of the recipe, the recipe summary, and the time it takes to complete the recipe.

If the user is happy with the results, they have the option to "save to favorites" which will save their movie and recipe to their local storage.

When the user saves their recipe and movie, it will save to local storage and then display onto a carousel at the bottom of the page.  If the user is unhappy with their results, then they can continue to repeat the above process until they land on a movie and recipe they are happy with.
