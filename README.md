# Date-night-in
The objective of this project is to create a website that will allow customized date night for the users.

User story

So as someone who is trying to plan a date night in, I would like to be able to generate a meal and something to watch randomly so I donâ€™t have to actually plan anything myself.

As a user I want to be able to generate a date-night-in and save for future use in order to prepare (example - purchasing certain ingredients).

As a user I want to be able to generate a meal and filter recipes by allergies and dietary needs to cater to those who have dietary restrictions.

As a user I want to be able to filter by type of cuisine.

As a user I want to be able to generate movies by genre.

As a user I want to be able to generate movies by review ratings.

As a user I want to be able to filter my movies between paid steamed services VS free streaming services.

As a user I want to be able to filter my movies based off ratings (PG, PG-13, Rated-R)

finally got to this point of the test lol
